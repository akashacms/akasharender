We obviously use CSS files to customize the look and structure of websites.

In AkashaRender - configuration for CSS files

Simplest way is to put CSS files in `assets` directory

LESS simplifies using CSS files

Put your LESS file in `documents` directory structure as `file-name.css.less` ... then declare it in configuration as `file-name.css`
